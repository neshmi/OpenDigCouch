# OpenDig CouchApp #
This is a lightweight data reader for the OpenDig CouchDB data.  It is not meant to be more than just a way to get quick access to data while in the field.  It only requires Ruby and a gem called 'soca'.  

## Installation ##

```
bundle install
```

Create a .couchapprc file, see the example for the format.

```
soca push
```

Or for production:

```
soca push production
```
